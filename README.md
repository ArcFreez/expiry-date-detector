# expiry-date-detector
This is the final project for my comptuer vision graduate class at Colorado School of Mines.

# what is needed to run this project
- A working anaconda environment using opencv4.0.1, numpy, and python3.8 or 3.7.

# about how this project is organized
- The `code` directory contains the code.
- The `data` directory contains the data used for testing.
- The `project-proposal` contains our project proposal.
- The `research` just contains a README on some rough
work we used to track our research.
- The `training_data` contains the templates used
for template matching, and code used to generate them from
`dot-mat-sq-chars` directory. 

# how to run the code
0. Activate conda env
1. Go into code directory
2. Run the python file.
3. It will produce outputs and images which
you will have to hit `enter` your way through to
finish running. But overall,
the output will be in the log files.
